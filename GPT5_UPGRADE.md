## 💰 **Cost Savings**

### **Per Scoring (1000 token average)**

| Model                         | Input Cost | Output Cost | **Total/Scoring** | **Savings** |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| **gpt-4-turbo-preview** (old) | $0.010     | $0.030      | **$0.020**        | -           |
| **gpt-5** (new)               | $0.00125   | $0.010      | **$0.006**        | **70% ↓**   |

### **Per Clarification (200 token average)**

| Model                         | Input Cost | Output Cost | **Total**  | **Savings** |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| **gpt-4-turbo-preview** (old) | $0.002     | $0.006      | **$0.008** | -           |
| **gpt-5-mini** (new)          | $0.0001    | $0.0008     | **$0.001** | **87% ↓**   |

### **Monthly Savings Estimate**

Assuming 10,000 users/month with average:

- 5 questions per user
- 3 clarifications per question

**Old Cost:**

- Scoring: 50,000 × $0.020 = **$1,000**
- Clarifications: 150,000 × $0.008 = **$1,200**
- **Total: $2,200/month**

**New Cost:**

- Scoring: 50,000 × $0.006 = **$300**
- Clarifications: 150,000 × $0.001 = **$150**
- **Total: $450/month**

**💰 Monthly Savings: $1,750 (80% reduction!)**
